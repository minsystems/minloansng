If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.

Except of described above, the Site gathers the type of general information and data when an information subject or computerized system utilizes the site. This general information and data are kept away in the server log files. Gathered information and data might be: (1) the version and types of browsers used, (2) the type of electronic device you use, (3) your unique electronic device ID, (4) the operating system used by the accessing system, (5) software and hardware attributes, (6) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (purported referrers), (7) information about the way you use the website, (8) the sub-sites, (9) the date and time of access to the Internet website, (10) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (11) the Internet service provider of the accessing system.

How we process Personal Data
We will use your Personal Data only in accordance with our Privacy Policy. If you do not wish us to continue using your Personal Data in this manner, you can request that your details to be deleted or redacted by contacting us via email support@Minloans, Minmarket and Minaccounts.com .

We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity (i.e. processing that is necessary for the performance of a contract with you) and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others (e.g. our users) such as:
- personalising, improving or operating our services and business
- better understanding your needs and interests
- fulfilling requests you make related to the services
- providing you with information and offers from us or third parties
- complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, enforcing our agreements
- protecting, investigating and deterring against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized or illegal activity.

If you reside in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, Iceland or Switzerland, you Personal Data processing may be based on the lawful basis described below.

Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR). Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.

We process Personal Data for purposes such as:
- to process your orders and deliver the services that you have ordered
- to provide reports based on information collected from use of our services
- to keep you up to date on the latest service announcements, service updates, special offers and other information
- to provide support and assistance for our services
- to provide the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content
- to meet contract or legal obligations

You may opt out of receiving such marketing email messages by unsubscribing from our database via internal link within the email or directly mailing us - support@Minloans, Minmarket and Minaccounts.com .

IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Additionally, for systems administration, detecting usage patterns and troubleshooting purposes, our web servers automatically log standard access information including browser type, access times/open mail, URL requested, and referral URL. This information is not shared with third parties and is used only within this Minloans, Minmarket and Minaccounts on a need-to-know basis.
